This program is designed to extract data from a twitter account and edit the data to make them useful for representation using Tweepy and Twitter API.
to use this program you have to:
1) have a developer account on Twitter. To get that go to: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access and apply for access to use the API tools.
2) Once an access is granted, you can create an application and replace the: API key, API Secret, Access Token Key, Access Token Secret with the ones you have in your created application.
3) If you do not have tweepy, textblob, wordcloud, or pandas libraries you might want to use the following command: pip install <package name>.
  EX: pip install tweepy
NOTE: if you still can't access the library then open your IDE's prompt (ex: Anaconda Prompt) and type the command in it instead of your local OS command prompt.
4) Now, you are ready to start the program and see how data is manipulated and visualized.
